## While Loop

[While Loop](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/while-loop) is used to repeat a block of code until a certain condition is met. For Example:

```
## Create a variable.
ans = eval(input("enter a number: "))

## Create a condition that will loop a long as the condition is True. (ans <= 10)
while ans <= 10:
    print(ans)
    ans = ans + 1
 
## Once the condition True, (ans <= 10) it will then stop the loop.
print("loop is done")

```
